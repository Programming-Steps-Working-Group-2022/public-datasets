Prompt:

Write a one-parameter function askPassword. When
the function is called, it asks the user for a pass-
word until the user enters the correct password.
The correct password is given to the function as
a parameter. When the user enters the correct
password (i.e., the user's input corresponds to the
value received as a parameter), the program prints
the message 'Thank you!' To ask for a password,
use the string 'Enter password.'

Below is an example of the function when the function
is called in the form askPassword('turnip');

Enter password.
< cauliflower
Enter password.
< carrot
Enter password.
< turnip
Thank you!

Solution:

askPassword(password) {
  while(true) {
    print('Enter password.');
    var answer = stdin.readLineSync();
    if (answer == password) {
      break;
    }
  }
  print('Thank you!');
}
