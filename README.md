This repository publishes resources related to the programming steps working group at ITiCSE'22 conference.

### See the working group report here: ###

https://doi.org/10.1145/3571785.3574124

The report selects following 5 datasets. We publish the working group's expert annotations for the two first datasets and link the others here as well for convenience.

### CodingBat ###

The working group's expert annotation in selected programming steps is published in this repository under `CodingBat`. We are not allowed to republish the original dataset and the annotation data must be joined with the original dataset by the receiver.

### FITech ###

This data includes 25 sequences of programming steps where students work on introductory programming tasks. Task descriptions are included. We publish this data here for the fist time and include the working group's expert annotation in selected programming steps. The data is published in slightly modified Progsnap2-format in this repository under `FITech`.
